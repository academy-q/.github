# Q-Academy: Integrated Learning & Healthcare Platform

## Project Overview

Q-Academy is a comprehensive platform that integrates student activity tracking with Telemedicine and Electronic Health Records (EHR), specifically designed for students with disabilities in the Philippines. This all-in-one solution connects SPED Doctors, Teachers, Parents, and Students in a unified ecosystem to improve healthcare support, educational outcomes, and communication between all stakeholders. 

The platform addresses critical challenges in the Philippines' special education sector, including the severe shortage of specialized doctors, long appointment wait times (currently 2-3 years when assessments should occur every 6 months), and the need for standardized reporting to the Department of Education.

## üéØ Core Mission

Our mission is to bridge the gap between education and healthcare for students with disabilities in the Philippines by providing seamless access to specialized support through a single integrated platform. We aim to solve critical problems in the SPED sector, including the severe shortage of specialists (only 50+ doctors serving 30,000+ patients), extremely long appointment wait times (2-3 years), and the need for more effective communication between healthcare providers, educators, and families.
